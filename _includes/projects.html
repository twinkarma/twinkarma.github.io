        <p>Receptive vocabulary (picture vocabulary) testing is used widely by speech and language therapists as a form of assessment of a personâ€™s verbal comprehension. The test prescribes a series of questions in the form of a verbal instruction and four multiple-choice image answers. The Human Communications Department has approached the ACRC to start development of the Receptive Vocabulary Screener mobile application for testing children with additional languages or monolingual children with language weaknesses.</p>
